                            <p>My name is Jared Smith, and I am a freshman at 
                            Dublin High School of California. You can contact me 
                            at jared@overwatchdmc.com. In my future, I plan to 
                            work in the same field as my Dad, data science and 
                            statistics. I also plan to graduate from UC Davis, 
                            the same college as my parents, with a degree in 
                            statistics. To achieve these goals, I plan to take 
                            as many math courses as possible, and might take AP 
                            statistics my senior year. I also plan to work hard 
                            during school, and study for all subjects, with an 
                            emphasis on math. This is my current career choice, 
                            as I am extremely interested in the subjects of machine 
                            learning for data science and statistics in the world. 
                            I also would like to follow in my parent's footsteps, 
                            as I look up to them.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Related to this career, I posses most of the necessary 
                            skills to work in this field. I am intelligent and persistent, 
                            which is necessary to work in this field, as there are a 
                            lot of complex problems that must be solved in order 
                            to find out the best ad placement, or what will get 
                            the most clicks. These solutions often do not work 
                            on the first try, so you must be persistent in 
                            attempting to solve the problem. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Some of my accomplishments throughout the years include 
                            getting a 4.0 GPA in 6th and 7th grade, and a 3.8 throughout 
                            most of 8th. I also played baseball for the Dublin Little 
                            League, and I am currently in two clubs, the Student 
                            Athletic Leadership Team and the Spread a Smile club. 
                            These achievements have also taught me that I am a 
                            natural born leader, as people look up to me for 
                            inspiration, and often come to me when they need help 
                            with a problem or do not understand what to do. I have 
                            also learned that I work well in teams, and can hold 
                            my own and support the team when necessary if someone 
                            is not staying up to the standards they need to.
