                For this project, we were tasked with creating a hangman 
                game with a basic theme or themes. We decided on a theme of movie
                titles, and got to work building the basic functions of our game,
                such as guess checking and updating a display. We did have some

                For this project, we were tasked with creating a text adventure 
                game with a storypath and user input. We decided on a basic storyline,
                which would be modified over the course of the project. We then 
                began to code one room at a time, slowly creating our vision
                for the project. You can play our game through the embedded

                For our Second project in Computer Science Principles, we were
                tasked with designing a game in MIT App Inventor. My partner and I 
                based our game of of the tutorial Oh My Spikes, and added mnay more 
                functions to it. We took the base game and added a level system,
                powerups, including making your character bigger or smaller,
                and multiple enemies when you reach the alloted level. We also 
                changed all of the items to match items from the game Minecraft, 
                including the lava and Skeleton.

                For our first project in Computer Science Principles, my partner
                and I had to choose whether to make a game or to make a story. 
                We went with the game, and created a platformer from scratch over
                the course of the project. I wrote most of the code, while my 
                partner helped to design levels and finish the parts that I could
                not. It has multiple levels, with a lives 
                system and 2 mini bosses, with one final boss at the end. We did
                run into some problems when creating the bosses, as there are 
                a lot of codes that get broadcast, which was sometimes causing issues, 
                and sometimes the bosses lives would not go down or your lives would 
                go down when you hit the boss. There is
                also a speed run option, which enables a timer to track how fast 
                you can beat the game. Try it out with the embed! Sometimes there can 
                be a glitch where it does not display the correct instructions, 
                but simply restart and it will. Also, if you get the message that 
                it can't be loaded because flash is not running, click the link 
                and allow flash.
