                For our first project in Computer Science Principles, my partner
                and I had to choose whether to make a game or to make a story. 
                We went with the game, and created a platformer from scratch over
                the course of the project. It has multiple levels, with a lives 
                system and 2 mini bosses, with one final boss at the end. There is
                also a speed run option, which enables a timer to track how fast 
                you can beat the game. Try it out with the embed! Sometimes there can 
                be a glitch where it does not display the correct instructions, 
                but simply restart and it will. Also, if you get the message that 
                it can't be loaded because flash is not running, click the link 
                and allow flash.

                For my birthday, I recieved a 3D printer kit, known as the Tevo
                Tarantula. During the following weeks, I began to build it, putting 
                together the frame, then the bed and the gantry, and finally assembling
                and wiring everything together. This project helped to test my patience, 
                as printing an object is not fast, and my ingenuity, as there
                were many problems along the way that also needed to be fixed. The 
                reason this project has not ended yet is because I am still upgrading 
                and modifying to this very day, to continue to make it safer and more
                accurate in printing. (Note the printed brackets to make it 
                more secure)
